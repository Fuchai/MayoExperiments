## What is this repository?
This is a set of machine learning experiments that I run in order to understand the mechanics of some models, to
quickly prototype and examine some ideas.

This is my research done at Mayo Clinic for the summer of 2018. This is my personal research that does not use any
data from Mayo Clinic.
