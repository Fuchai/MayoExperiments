# This is a fake data generation file. Time series converted to fake longitudinal.
# What marks a longitudinal data is the signal sparsity by time.
# We will insert longitudinal data, but we do not expect the machine to make
# correct prediction on the sparsity location. Well. I think patient's visit
# timing is largely unpredictable. Also, to generate this dataset, it's convenient
# to insert blanks without rules.

# I think the easiest way to generate fake data is to modify the raw
# text file. Would it be doable?
# On the cost evaluation, they should not be marked as answers.
